1. Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual properties or attributes that can be adjusted or mapped to represent the underlying data. They are used to encode and communicate information effectively in a visual form. Here are a few examples of aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization:
Color: The use of different colors to represent different categories or values in the data.
Size: Varying the size of visual elements, such as points or bars, to represent a quantitative dimension.
Shape: Using different shapes, such as circles or squares, to represent different categories or data points.
Position: Placing visual elements in different positions to convey information, such as using a scatter plot to show the relationship between two variables.
Orientation: Adjusting the orientation or angle of visual elements to convey information, such as the slope of a line in a line chart.
