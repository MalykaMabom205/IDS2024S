1. All data visualizations that map data values into features that are quantifable features of a resulting graphic.
2. Discrete and continous.
3. Variables holding qualitaive data are factors and the levels are the different categories.
4. Continous and an examples would be quantitative. For discrete ordered and unordered. 
5. Graphs
6. Ordered data would fall under quantitative numerical, whereas  unordered data would fall under qualitiatve catergorical.
7. Cartesian longitiude and latitude, Robinson, winkel tripel.
8. (1) Quaitative color scale distinguishes discrete items or groups thayt don't have an intrinic order.
   (2) Sequential color scales contains a sequence of colors that visually indicates which values are larger or smaller.
   (3) Diverging color scale visualizes the deivation of data values in one of two directions relative to a midppoint.
   (4) Accent color scales coanint a set of subdued colors and matching set of stronger, or brighter or darker colors used to
   highlight specfic elements in data.
10. They're confusing to read and intrepret hence why Data Scientists tend to stay away from using 3d plots.
